# Module 3 -- Hyperparameters tuning

## Wrap-up
* **Hyperparameters** have an impact on the modelsâ€™ performance and should be wisely chosen;

* The search for the best hyperparameters can be automated with a grid-search approach or a randomized search approach;

* A **grid-search** is expensive and does not scale when the number of hyperparameters to optimize increase. Besides, the combination are sampled only on a regular grid.

* A **randomized-search** allows a search with a fixed budget even with an increasing number of hyperparameters. Besides, the combination are sampled on a non-regular grid.
