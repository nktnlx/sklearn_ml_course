# Module 1 -- The Predictive Modeling Pipeline

## Wrap-up
In this module, we've learned:
* to create a scikit-learn predictive model;
* about the scikit-learn API to train and test a predictive model;
* to process numerical data, notably using a Pipeline.
* to process categorical data, notably using a OneHotEncoder and an OrdinalEncoder;
* to handle and process mixed data types (i.e. numerical and categorical data), notably using a ColumnTransformer.
